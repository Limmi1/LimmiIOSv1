//  Purpose: Location services abstraction for GPS-based rule evaluation
//  Dependencies: Foundation, CoreLocation, Combine
//  Related: BlockingEngine.swift, GPS location rules, CoreLocationProvider implementation
//

import Foundation
import CoreLocation
import Combine

/// Protocol abstraction for location services in the blocking system.
///
/// This protocol provides a clean interface for location operations, enabling:
/// - Dependency injection for testability
/// - Flexibility to switch between location providers
/// - Clean separation between business logic and CoreLocation APIs
///
/// ## Usage in Blocking Engine
/// Location data is used for GPS-based rule evaluation:
/// - Rule specifies GPS coordinates and radius
/// - Current location is compared against rule boundaries
/// - Location changes trigger rule re-evaluation
///
/// ## Implementation Strategy
/// - **Production**: CoreLocationProvider using actual GPS hardware
/// - **Testing**: MockLocationProvider with controllable location data
/// - **Future**: Could support additional providers (network location, etc.)
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
/// - Uses distance filtering to minimize unnecessary updates
/// - Balances accuracy needs with battery life
/// - Integrates with app background execution limitations
///
/// - Since: 1.0
protocol LocationProvider {
    /// Publisher that emits location updates for reactive rule evaluation.

    /// Used by blocking engine to trigger GPS-based rule evaluation.
    var locationPublisher: AnyPublisher<CLLocation, Never> { get }

    /// 
    /// May be nil if location services haven't provided a reading yet
    /// or if location access is denied.
    var currentLocation: CLLocation? { get }
    
    /// Current CoreLocation authorization status.
    /// 
    /// GPS-based rules require .authorizedWhenInUse or .authorizedAlways.
    var authorizationStatus: CLAuthorizationStatus { get }
    
    /// Requests location authorization using progressive escalation.
    /// 
    /// Implements the standard iOS pattern: first requests "When In Use",
    /// then escalates to "Always" for background operation.
    func requestAuthorization()
    
    /// Starts continuous location monitoring.
    /// 
    /// Begins publishing location updates via locationPublisher.
    /// Requires appropriate authorization to succeed.
    func startLocationUpdates()
    
    /// Stops location monitoring to conserve battery.
    /// 
    /// Ceases location updates and publisher emissions.
    func stopLocationUpdates()
    
    /// Updates monitored regions based on active rules.
    /// 
    /// For providers that support region monitoring (like RegionMonitoringLocationProvider),
    /// this updates the set of GPS regions being monitored. For basic providers, this is a no-op.
    func updateRegions(from rules: [Rule])
}

/// Production implementation of LocationProvider using CoreLocation framework.
///
/// This class wraps CoreLocation's CLLocationManager to provide location services
/// for GPS-based rule evaluation. Configured for balanced accuracy and battery life.
///
/// ## Configuration
/// - **Accuracy**: kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters (good balance)
/// - **Distance Filter**: 10 meters (reduces update frequency)
/// - **Authorization**: Progressive escalation (When In Use â†’ Always)
///
/// ## Background Behavior
/// - Location updates work in background with "Always" authorization
/// - Updates may be throttled by iOS to conserve battery
/// - Distance filtering prevents excessive rule evaluation
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// - Must be accessed from main thread due to CLLocationManagerDelegate
/// - Location updates are published on main thread for UI integration
///
/// - Since: 1.0
